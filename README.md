# Bifr√∂st
WebP Advanced API wrapper for Android

Import 'bifrost' module into your project to use.

JNI code is rebuilt with:
```
cd bifrost/jni/
ndk-build
```

This will place binaries in bifrost/libs and bifrost/obj. You then want to do...

```
mv bifrost/libs/{armeabi,armeabi-v7a,x86} src/main/jniLibs/
```

...as ndk-build places these wrong for Android Studio. The obj/ directory is redundant.

The jni/ folder contains the libwebp source code with a custom JNI wrapper (wrapper/Bifrost.*) and Application.mk added. To use with your own version of libwebp, preserve these custom files, replace the jni/ folder with libwebp, put the files back in their place, and add wrapper/Bifrost.c back to LOCAL_SRC_FILES in the Android.mk file.
